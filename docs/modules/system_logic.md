# 🧠 System Logic Module

---

## 🎯 Purpose

> The **System Logic** module is the brain of the operation, responsible for determining the system state based on sensor readings. It implements the core decision-making logic of the environmental controller, comparing temperature and humidity readings against thresholds and tracking critical conditions over time.

## 📝 Responsibilities

-   **🌡️ Threshold Checking**
    -   Compare temperature readings against caution (`45°C`) and danger (`60°C`) thresholds.
    -   Compare humidity readings against caution (`30%` / `70%`) and danger (`20%` / `80%`) thresholds.
    -   Determine the appropriate system state based on these comparisons.
-   **🚦 State Management**
    -   Manage transitions between the four system states: `NORMAL`, `CAUTION`, `DANGER`, `SHUTDOWN`.
    -   Ensure state transitions follow the defined state diagram.
    -   Prevent erratic state changes during fluctuating conditions.
-   **⏱️ Critical Condition Tracking**
    -   Track the duration of critical temperature conditions.
    -   Manage the 20-second countdown timer for system shutdown.
    -   Reset the timer when conditions return to safer levels.

## 💾 Data Structures

### `SystemState` Enumeration

```c
typedef enum {
    NORMAL,   // ✅ All parameters within safe range
    CAUTION,  // ⚠️ At least one parameter in caution range
    DANGER,   // 🔥 At least one parameter in danger range
    SHUTDOWN  // 🛑 Critical temperature sustained for required period
} SystemState;
```

### `CriticalTimer` Structure

```c
typedef struct {
    int seconds_at_critical;  // ⏳ Time spent at critical temperature
    bool timer_active;        // 🏃 Whether the shutdown timer is running
} CriticalTimer;
```

## ⚙️ Functions

### `checkTemperature()`

-   **Purpose**: Evaluates temperature reading against thresholds.
-   **Parameters**: `float` temperature value.
-   **Returns**: Appropriate state based on temperature.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Returns `NORMAL` if temperature is ≤ `45°C`.
    -   Returns `CAUTION` if temperature is > `45°C` and ≤ `60°C`.
    -   Returns `DANGER` if temperature is > `60°C`.

### `checkHumidity()`

-   **Purpose**: Evaluates humidity reading against thresholds.
-   **Parameters**: `float` humidity value.
-   **Returns**: Appropriate state based on humidity.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Returns `NORMAL` if humidity is between `30%` and `70%`.
    -   Returns `CAUTION` if humidity is < `30%` or > `70%` but not in the danger range.
    -   Returns `DANGER` if humidity is < `20%` or > `80%`.

### `determineSystemState()`

-   **Purpose**: Determines the overall system state based on both temperature and humidity.
-   **Parameters**: `SensorReading` struct containing temperature and humidity.
-   **Returns**: The current `SystemState`.
-   **Behavior**: Takes the more severe state between the temperature and humidity evaluations.

### `updateCriticalTimer()`

-   **Purpose**: Manages the shutdown countdown timer.
-   **Parameters**: Current `SystemState`, time delta.
-   **Returns**: `bool` indicating whether a shutdown should occur.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Increments the timer when in a `DANGER` state due to temperature.
    -   Resets the timer when not in a temperature-based `DANGER` state.
    -   Returns `true` when the timer exceeds 20 seconds.
