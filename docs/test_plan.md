# Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for Server-Sentinel-C, ensuring that the system behaves correctly under all simulated conditions.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Full Meltdown
- **Description**: Simulates a complete cooling system failure leading to system shutdown
- **Steps**:
  1. Run the program
  2. Enter command: `fail_cooling`
  3. Do not intervene
- **Expected Results**:
  - System transitions from NORMAL to CAUTION state when temperature exceeds 45°C
  - System transitions to DANGER state when temperature exceeds 60°C
  - System displays SHUTDOWN message after 20 seconds at critical temperature
  - Program terminates

### Scenario 2: Successful Intervention
- **Description**: Tests recovery from critical conditions
- **Steps**:
  1. Run the program
  2. Enter command: `fail_cooling`
  3. Wait for DANGER alert
  4. Enter command: `fix`
- **Expected Results**:
  - System transitions from NORMAL to CAUTION to DANGER
  - After `fix` command, temperature decreases
  - System transitions back to CAUTION and then NORMAL
  - Shutdown timer is canceled

### Scenario 3: Humidity Alert Only
- **Description**: Tests humidity-specific alerts
- **Steps**:
  1. Run the program
  2. Enter command: `humidity_spike`
- **Expected Results**:
  - System issues CAUTION alerts when humidity exceeds 70%
  - System issues DANGER alerts when humidity exceeds 80%
  - System does not shut down (shutdown is tied only to temperature)

### Scenario 4: Intermittent Failure
- **Description**: Tests system response to fluctuating conditions
- **Steps**:
  1. Run the program
  2. Enter command: `intermittent`
- **Expected Results**:
  - System alternates between states as conditions fluctuate
  - System does not trigger false shutdowns
  - Alerts correspond to current conditions

## Test Execution
Each test scenario will be executed and documented with:
- Screenshots of console output
- Timestamps of state transitions
- Log data analysis

## Acceptance Criteria
- All test scenarios pass without unexpected behavior
- System correctly transitions between states based on thresholds
- Logging system captures all events correctly
- Alert system provides appropriate notifications
- Shutdown protocol triggers only when conditions warrant
